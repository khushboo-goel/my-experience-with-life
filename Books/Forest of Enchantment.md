# Forest of Enchantment by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni

This one is retelling of Ramayana from Sita's perspective, the Sitayan. The story isn't ofcourse different. Unlike Amish Tripathi's retelling of Ramayana from Sita's POV in the Sita: the Warrior of Mithila, it is a beat by beat story, just from Sita's POV. Within that restrain, this is one fine story. Nobody is villian here, not even Kaikayi. Divakaruni is approcahing this material with a matriarchial POV, telling story of every female character that the actual Ramayana lacks, what they want out of a relationship and when to take the stand for yourself.
