# The Kite Runner - By Khaled Hosseini

Review:
This book really wrentched my heart. I have read the `The thousand splendid suns` as well in the past but I dont think that had this profound effect. Sure, some can call this book manipulative for all reasons. In my opinion, stories are written to invoke some emotions and make you think about the life from a different perspective, and this did it fairly well.
